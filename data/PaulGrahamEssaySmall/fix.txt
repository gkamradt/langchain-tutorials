Kevin Kelleher suggested an interesting way to compare programming
languages: to describe each in terms of the problem it
fixes.  The surprising thing is how many, and how well, languages can be
described this way.

Algol: Assembly language is too low-level.Pascal: Algol doesn't have enough data types.Modula: Pascal is too wimpy for systems programming.
Simula: Algol isn't good enough at simulations.Smalltalk: Not everything in Simula is an object.Fortran: Assembly language is too low-level.Cobol: Fortran is scary.PL/1: Fortran doesn't have enough data types.Ada: Every existing language is missing something.Basic: Fortran is scary.APL: Fortran isn't good enough at manipulating arrays.J: APL requires its own character set.C: Assembly language is too low-level.C++: C is too low-level.Java: C++ is a kludge.  And Microsoft is going to crush us.C#: Java is controlled by Sun.
Lisp: Turing Machines are an awkward way to describe computation.Scheme: MacLisp is a kludge.T: Scheme has no libraries.Common Lisp: There are too many dialects of Lisp.Dylan: Scheme has no libraries, and Lisp syntax is scary.
Perl: Shell scripts/awk/sed are not enough like programming languages.Python: Perl is a kludge.Ruby: Perl is a kludge, and Lisp syntax is scary.Prolog: Programming is not enough like logic.
